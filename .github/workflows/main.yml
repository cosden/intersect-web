# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the gh-pages branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ gh-pages ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ gh-pages ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      #    # Firstly, let's check-out our code.
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@gh-pages

    # Now let's configure this environment to support NodeJS tooling.
    - uses: actions/setup-node@gh-pages

    # Now run an npm install...
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install

    # Run the build-script, which is a package.json script in this case.
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
      env:
        CI: true # This is done to prevent output being too verbose.

    # Use Github's upload-artifact action to upload our hopefully-successful build!
    # We only want the `public` folder here which contains our (optimised) static site.
    - name: Save Build Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
      with:
        name: site-artifact # A unique key (and name) for the artifact in question.
        path: public        # This is what we'd like to keep, we want `public` but any file/folder works
