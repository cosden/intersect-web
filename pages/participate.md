## Ways to participate
1. Workshops - If you consider yourself an RSE and
  * you have experience giving research software development training
  * you have never formally served as a trainer
  * you have no interest in being a trainer or giving a workshop, but would like to give your input on the material and skills that are needed in the profession.
1. Bootcamps - If you have a baseline knowledge and are looking to expand your research software engineering skill set
1. Asynchronous Training Material - If you want to contribute to the mission of curating and developing specific training topics
